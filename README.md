# Fleet-Management-Dashboard-In-Figma
This is my first project in Figma. It’s a smart and interactive Fleet Management Dashboard that helps monitor vehicles, track driver performance, manage alerts, and handle system operations  all from one clean and user-friendly interface.
Built with a user-friendly UI, this dashboard helps fleet managers keep track of vehicle safety scores, configure alerts, view driver reports, and manage overall fleet operations — all in one place.
Perfect for logistics or transport businesses to manage their fleet effectively and improve safety.
